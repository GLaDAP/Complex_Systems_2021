## Propose 3 strategies for firefighting ##
1. Random movements - fight if fire is encountered
2. Fight closest fire
3. Fight largest fire
4. Call fighting plane
(5. Collective strategy, might be to complex for the size of this project.)

### 1. RANDOM FIGHTING ###
- Take step in random direction
- If fire is encountered:
      - Fight fire

### 2. FIGHT CLOSEST FIRE/BURNING TREE ###
- burning_trees = 0
- For x,y in search_range:
      - If (x,y) = burning_tree:
            - burning_trees +- 1 
- If burning_trees > 0:
      - For i in range(burning_trees):
            - Measure distance (# steps) to tree
      - Determine closest burrning tree (with coordinates x_closest_tree, y_closest_tree)
      - If x_agent < x_closest_tree:
        - x_agent += 1
      - Elif x_agent > x_closest_tree:
        - x_agent -= 1
      - Elif y_agent < y_closest_tree:
        - y_agent += 1
      - Elif y_agent > y_closest_tree:
        - y_agent -= 1
      - Else:
        - Fight fire
- Else:
  - Take step in random direction
  
### 3. FIGHT LARGEST FIRE ###
- fires = []
- For x,y in search_range:
      - If (x,y) = burning_tree:
            - fire = (x,y)
            - next_tree_burning = True
            - while next_tree_burning:
                  - If (x+1,y) = burning_tree:
                        - fire = (x+1,y) ######################## WIP
- If len(fires) > 0:
      - Take closest tree of largest fire as target (with coordinates x_closest_tree, y_closest_tree)
      - If x_agent < x_closest_tree:
        - x_agent += 1
      - Elif x_agent > x_closest_tree:
        - x_agent -= 1
      - Elif y_agent < y_closest_tree:
        - y_agent += 1
      - Elif y_agent > y_closest_tree:
        - y_agent -= 1
      - Else:
        - Fight fire
- Else:
  - Take step in random direction
  
### 4. CALL FIGHTING PLANE ###
- Similar to "FIGHT LARGEST FIRE", find largest fire within observation range
- Either send plane that solves larger area, or that has higher impact on intensity
  
  
Notes:
- Search range could be parameter setting

### 5. Setting fire line/ fire break (maybe not an agent)
      -fire lines could be straight& vertical lines in the grid.
      -remove the trees which on the fire line.
      -fire has a lower probability to cross the fire line/ only the fire with a certain intensity can cross the fire line.
      -set multiple fire lines.
